    "Covariance and correlation are both measures used to assess the relationship between two variables, but they differ in several key aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Definition:\n",
    "Covariance: Covariance measures the extent to which two variables change together. It indicates the direction of the relationship (positive or negative) and whether the variables tend to increase or decrease together. Covariance can take both positive and negative values.\n",
    "Correlation: Correlation is a standardized measure of the relationship between two variables. It quantifies the strength and direction of the linear association between variables and is always between -1 and 1. Correlation measures how closely the data points of the two variables align along a straight line, regardless of the scale of the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Scale:\n",
    "Covariance: The covariance value is not scaled and depends on the scale of the data. Larger values of covariance do not necessarily indicate stronger relationships, as they are influenced by the magnitudes of the variables themselves.\n",
    "Correlation: The correlation coefficient is a standardized measure and always ranges from -1 to 1. A correlation of +1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Interpretation:\n",
    "Covariance: Covariance is challenging to interpret alone, especially when comparing different pairs of variables with different scales. It provides information about the direction of the relationship but does not tell us the strength of the association.\n",
    "Correlation: Correlation is easier to interpret and compare since it is standardized. The correlation coefficient allows us to understand the strength and direction of the linear relationship between variables. It helps in comparing the relationships of different pairs of variables on a consistent scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Range:\n",
    "Covariance: Covariance can take any real value, positive or negative, without any upper or lower limit.\n",
    "Correlation: Correlation is bounded between -1 and 1, making it easier to interpret and compare relationships."

    "Outliers can significantly impact both measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode) and measures of dispersion (range, variance, and standard deviation). An outlier is an extreme value that lies far away from the majority of the data points in a dataset. These extreme values can distort the overall characteristics of the data distribution, affecting both the central tendency and spread of the data.\n",

    "Median: The median is the middle value of the dataset when arranged in ascending or descending order.\n",

    "Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset.\n",
    "Mode = 28 and 30 (both occur twice)\n",

    "In this example, the dataset contains an outlier (50). This extreme value is significantly larger than the other values, and it affects the measures of central tendency as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean is sensitive to outliers, and the value of 50 pulls the mean towards the higher end. As a result, the mean (29.4) is larger than the median (28) and the mode (28 and 30).\n",
    "Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.\n",
    "Range = 50 - 25 = 25\n",

    "Variance and Standard Deviation: Variance measures the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean. Standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n",

    "Standard Deviation ≈ √60.84 ≈ 7.79\n",
